Version 2-4-3: "Extract Spirit" Bug Fix

Latest version is 2-4-3.
Spells that result in a sim's death should be working again. Something broke them to where the sim died, but never became a ghost. This was tied into the problems with Extract Spirit, which has now been fixed too.
Added a somewhat revised French translation by Llumex (apologies to Llumex for the months long delay in adding it).
