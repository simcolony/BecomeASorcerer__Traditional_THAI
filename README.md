Version 3.0: Specializations

Latest versio Version 3-3
Stasis Field should now be working more reliably and consistently again.
Added a Mass version of Dispel Enchantment, found under Spells > Mass. This can be used to dispel Stasis Field easily on a lot of sims at once, if you've used the Mass version of Stasis Field. It will also dispel any other spells that are built to involve the Dispel Enchantment command.
Llamadeus should now be excluded from most random roles that could place her in odd situations or getting her showing up at random once she's been summoned once, that sort of thing.
Minions should now be excluded from most random roles, walkbys, and the like, same as Llamadeus. This was done to try to limit the ways a Minion could get called away from your lot while you're away, to go fill some role on the lot you went to. This will hopefully reduce the instances of a Minion leaving your lot while you're gone. It doesn't reduce it to zero in my testing, but it may help.

Version 2-4-3: "Extract Spirit" Bug Fix

Latest version is 2-4-3.
Spells that result in a sim's death should be working again. Something broke them to where the sim died, but never became a ghost. This was tied into the problems with Extract Spirit, which has now been fixed too.
Added a somewhat revised French translation by Llumex (apologies to Llumex for the months long delay in adding it).
